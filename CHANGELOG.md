# Repeater Nation Radio — Changelog

## 0.1.3

- Fixed desktop update checks by using Tauri’s native HTTP client for GitHub instead of the WebView network layer.
- Added the GitHub API URL to the desktop HTTP permission scope.
- Added dedicated Zone selection to the radio controls; channel choices now follow the selected zone.

## Next — Zone selection

- Added a dedicated Zone selector to the desktop radio controls.
- Channel choices now follow the selected zone, making it easier to move between radio channel groups without scrolling through every channel.
- Changing zones or channels safely disconnects the current radio session before switching selections.

## Next — Website radio parity

- Reworked the desktop radio face to follow the Repeater Nation website radio widget layout and status presentation.
- Added zone/channel metadata to desktop radio-session requests so the same server-side channel validation and stale-selection fallback used by the website is available to the desktop app.
- Kept the existing LiveKit transport and PTT flow while improving the desktop radio display.


## Next — Google sign-in

- Added a Continue with Google option to the desktop sign-in screen.
- Added OAuth callback handling so Google sign-in can return to the desktop app with the authenticated Repeater Nation session.
- Existing email/password sign-in remains available.


## 0.1.2 — Radio audio and PTT reliability fix

- Fixed a PTT release race where releasing the mouse, touch control, Space, or Numpad 0 before the server finished granting transmit could leave the microphone keyed.
- Added transmit-request cancellation so an outdated PTT grant cannot publish a microphone after the user has already released the control.
- Fixed PTT cleanup so the local microphone is always unpublished and the server is sent a release request when transmit ends.
- Removed duplicate radio track event handling that could cause remote audio to be attached more than once.
- Kept direct-call audio isolated from the main radio audio path.
- Bumped the desktop app version from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2.

## 0.1.1 — Desktop authentication and packaging fix

- Fixed the Windows desktop app startup flow so it always presents the Repeater Nation sign-in screen instead of silently restoring an old desktop session.
- Fixed the sign-in flow to keep one Base44 client for the authenticated session.
- Added a clear Sign out / switch account action in Radio Settings.
- Improved radio channel loading and connection error handling.
- Added Windows icon generation before bundling so the installer has the required platform assets.
- Bumped the desktop app version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1.
- Existing Repeater Nation website code was not changed by this desktop-app release.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Repeater Nation Radio desktop release.
